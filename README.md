# DevContainers example project
Taken from a Microsoft lecture. This allows a multitier project to be worked on as one workspace without having to install a bunch of frameworks on the machine. This example utilizes a sample Python application and a sample dotnet API application, with a docker-compose that spins them up. 
Designed to work in Visual Studio Code.
